                The 2009 Tobacco Control Act took a critical step in ending one of the tactics used to target and addict children because it prohibited candy and other fruit flavored cigarettes.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the law <a href="https://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ucm246129.htm#governments" target="_blank" class="highlight">left out</a> non-cigarette tobacco products. That means little cigars, cigarillos, chew, e-cigarettes, and other non-cigarette tobacco products are still sold in flavors like strawberry, cotton candy, bubble gum, chocolate, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                The law also allows menthol flavored tobacco products of all types, making menthol the sole remaining flavor allowed in cigarettes.

                The tobacco industry spends almost $8.8 billion every year to market their products. That’s an average of $24 million per day.   The bulk of this advertising takes place in retail stores that are frequented by young people. Here is what our youth see all the time in retail stores across the state, and here is what Vermonters are doing to protect Vermont’s youth from the tobacco industry.

                tobacco marketing have been restricted, convenience stores, pharmacies, gas stations, and other retail outlets remain places where kids are certain to see colorful tobacco products and advertising. These ads and products (that look like candy and are sold in candy flavors) are often placed near candy and ice cream and/or at the eye level of youth. It is no coincidence that 85% of teenagers prefer Marlboro, Camel, and Newport, which are the three most heavily advertised brands.</p>

He never touched tobacco his whole life. I’ve kept that tradition all these years. I always discourage people from buying the products. I will not advertise it or discount it. I don’t want to see youth get hooked on something that’s going to be a real detriment to their health.”</p>
